// user database:

// initial element is added client-side

// entry: author: server-key, value: add-op server-key type:server, signature: self-signed by server

// then all currently trusted SERVER keys can use add-op and remove-op to add and remove keys
// roles: type:server, type:admin, type:manager, type:user

// also contains password, etc. but this is only send between servers and admins


// heads can be found by looking for hashes that are not in any "previous"
// how to do this efficiently

// first entry has no previous

// synchronization: both clients send their heads
// both look for the entries and search for all entries after them
// send these
