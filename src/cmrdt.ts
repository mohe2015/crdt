// TODO FIXME store name, role and signed identity somewhere to allow verification
// this could be send on connect, but for updates you would also need to send this if the user is not known to the other person
// maybe another table which contains that data as key value or so
// key value could have the advantage that a client can only request keys it knows about.

// maybe a database which contains all trusted "servers" which is also updated like this

// user database:

// initial element is added client-side

// entry: author: server-key, value: add-op server-key type:server, signature: self-signed by server

// then all currently trusted SERVER keys can use add-op and remove-op to add and remove keys
// roles: type:server, type:admin, type:manager, type:user

// also contains password, etc. but this is only send between servers and admins


// heads can be found by looking for hashes that are not in any "previous"
// how to do this efficiently

// first entry has no previous

// synchronization: both clients send their heads
// both look for the entries and search for all entries after them
// send these

// out of line auto-incrementing integer primary key | value | hash | previous | author | signature
// always store in topological order

// probably the original hash should be kept in history but random and value should be removed
// so the data can not be reconstructed. this of course breaks the cryptographic verifyability
// this is likely pretty bad as it would allow malicious users to add fake entries
// maybe just don't propagate that entry at all as it is not verified any more
// but then chains based on it are broken

// what if: we remove everything except of the hash (because we need it for future entry checking)
// you can't send that empty object to somebody else because it's not signed -> this is a problem as these users can't verify the chain
// you only trust it if you got the original one and deleted the data later

// as somebody who knows the original data COULD prove to anyone that the user sent that data by showing that the hash matches it shouldn't matter if we keep all other data except the actual value
// this would leak the user but it MAY be acceptable to do that

// perfect forward secrecy would be needed but this would make the whole thing useless as you couldn't trust the data any more (this would likely only work if all recipients are known ahead of time)

// now the user can verify the chain but doesn't know the data (except for bruteforce GODDAMMIT)

// maybe actually an unverified entry is better (removing everything except hash also to identify the entry). All users that can write there are trusted anyways so this should be fine.
// maybe the delete user should resign the deletion at least. then there is somebody to blame. (this makes sense as otherwise nobody could verify if it's allowed to be removed)
// users can delete their own entries.
